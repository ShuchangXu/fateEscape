Bravo!X Image Color Filter write by Razor Yhang 2014

# Intro:
Bravo!X is based on the GNU GPL Open Source Licence. You can change it as you needed. With Bravo!X Filter, you can simply and easily manipulate the color of your final graphics, including brightness, saturation, hue and color balance. All the parameters are Photoshop-like and accessible from other scripts, which means you can easily control it on the go.The API onRenderImage() is used by Bravo!X so this Filter require UNITY PRO.

# How to use:
  1.Drag the BravoX.cs script to the camera.
  2.That's it:)

  p.s:Please drag the shader "BravoXFilter" to the parameter "Shader" in the   BravoX script if the shader is not set by default.

# Notice:
  This filter is almost done but still in develop(that means it is poorly tested), I have tested it in 4.5.2 / 4.3 / 4.0 with my PC and it works fine. However I don't have environment to test it in MAC or any mobile device. You can change any implement details of it and make it work in your environment and project. And,it would be very helpful if you can tell me some platform unadaptable&failed problems.
